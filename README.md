## Use Cases

This extension is intended to support several use cases:
* **Automatic Record Pull and Push**:
		Developers will be able to seamlessly pull and push [OASF](https://docs.agntcy.org/oasf/open-agentic-schema-framework/) based records to the Agent Directory directly from VSCode.
* **Search and Configuration of MCP Servers for Github Copilot**:
		Developers using Github Copilot in Agent Mode will be able to discover MCP Servers within the Agent Directory and install them in VSCode. This will make it easier to leverage additional tools and functionalities exposed by MCP servers.
* **Configuration of Github Copilot Agent Mode**:
		The extension will allow developers to search for and apply specific configurations -such as prompts, models, or tools- stored as records in the Agent Directory to Github Copilot in Agent Mode.

## Features Details
